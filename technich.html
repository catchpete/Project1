<p>Like many post-World War II artists, Auerbach saw little need
to make sharp distinctions between figuration and abstraction.
Instead using boldly gestural strokes and thick impastos of
paint to render his subjects, Auerbach painted psychological
portraits and moody landscapes that captured the cultural
weariness and melancholia of the time brought on by the
devastations of the war.</p>
