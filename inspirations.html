        <p>Painter David Bomberg
        His Polytechnic tutor, the erratic but
        talented painter David Bomberg, became 
        exceedingly useful to him, encouraging
        him in his drawing and his study of the
        history of art. Auerbach remembered,
        that there was an atmosphere of research
        and radicalism in Bomberg's classes,
        which made it extremely stimulating for him.
