        <h4> Head of Leon Kossoff 1954 </h4>
        <p>Painter and friend Leon Kossoff was one of Auerbach's
          favorite subjects for himself. Here the fellow School
        of the London artist's face occupies nearly the entire picture plane,
        his head slightly tilted downward. Auerbach draws him
        in ghostly shades of grays, blacks, and whites; his features
        threatening to blur or vanish under the viscous layers of
        paint, which are almost sculptural, resembling one of Giacometti's
        attenuated figures. Kossoff's eyes are dark abysses, his mouth set
        in a taut line of contemplation as if he were a saint in an
        illuminated manuscript enduring afflictions of the soul.

        <h4>E.O.W. (Estella "Stella" Olive West)</h4>
        <p>E.O.W. was Auerbach's
        first obsession as a painterly subject. This work,
        one of several, is painted so thickly that the subject 
        is difficult to recognize; however, after careful looking
        and  the title, the viewer can
        see the naked figure of a woman, on a bed 
        with a blue coverlet. It is an special piece of work; she is
        clearly comfortable, lying on her back and propping
        one arm up behind her head. She seems to be looking
        casually out at the viewer, and her figure stretches
        from one side of the canvas to the other. The creamy
          color of her flesh and the bright blue of her bed are 
        the dominant colors, while the wall and floor are primarily 
        shades of taupe and burnt gold.</p>

        <h4>Bacchus and Ariadne (1971)</h4>
        <p>
        This piece is
        modeled after Titian's work of the same name concerning
        a tale from Ovid, in which Ariadne, abandoned by Theseus, 
        encounters the god Bacchus and his procession of revelers.
        Auerbach's rendition is completely abstract, consisting of
        dynamic horizontal, vertical, and diagonal brushstrokes in
        vibrant shades of cherry red, cerulean, golden yellow, abandoned
        grass green. Though referencing Titian's work might help viewers 
        interpret the brushstrokes as trees, figures, or the sea,
        Auerbach's painting is ultimately devoid of any explicit 
        figurative references</p>

        <h4>Primrose Hill</h4>
        <p>Auerbach's landscapes are like his portraits: 
        intuitively painted, comprised of manifold 
        perspectives, and precisely and methodically crafted.
        Primrose Hill, in North London near his studio, was one
        of Auerbach's favored landscape subjects. Like his many
        sitters, he painted it numerous times over the years, 
        in all seasons and times of day.</p>

        <h4>Head of J.Y.M. II</h4>
        <p>Juliet Yardley Mills, or J.Y.M., was a professional
        artists' model and posed for Auerbach twice a week for
        many years. This is one of the most notable works of 
        her, and though she is not as abstracted as, say, the
        aforementioned E.O.W. work, one would be hard-pressed
        to call this a "realistic" likeness. Both the people
        and style of the painting pack a visual punch; the 
        impact derives from the graceful but slightly
        disturbing curve of her neck and head back into the
        picture plane. </p>

        <h4>Chimney in Mornington Crescent - Winter Morning</h4>
        <p>Auerbach delights in painting his immediate surroundings 
        of Camden, the borough in London where he lives and works. 
        He has painted numerous works of the street of Mornington 
        Crescent, here depicting it on a frosty, barren morning.</p>
