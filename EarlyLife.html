  <h1>Early life</h1>
  <div class="content">
   <P> Frank Auerbach was born to Jewish parents in Berlin;
    his father was a lawyer and his mother an art student. In 1939, at the 
    age of eight, he was sent to England to escape  the Nazis. His parents, 
    who remained behind, had perished in the Holocaust. Auerbach 
    spent his childhood at Bunce Court, a progressive boarding school in Kent for
    Jewish refugees, where he excelled not only in art but also in drama. In 1947 
    he was naturalised a British citizen and moved to London, deciding, at the age 
    of 16, to become an artist. He attended painting classes at the Hampstead Garden
    Suburb Institute, going on to St Martin's School of Art, where he studied between
    1948 and 1952, meeting.</P>
